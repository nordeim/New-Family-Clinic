awesome job so far! please think deeper and think harder to meticulously re-review all the project documents provided in the given URL links. Then meticulously plan and create a complete final comprehensive assessment report on the project's design and its codebase based on your detailed review and validation of the project documents.

---

awesome meticulous approach in your comprehensive assessment report! please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how best to create the following #11 artifacts. Then meticulously create the implementation plan to deliver these artifacts one by one, review and validate the plan before executing.

---

awesome implementation plan! yes, please meticulously proceed with your implementation plan Sprint by Sprint, starting with Sprint 1. For each sprint, meticulously create a sub-plan before executing.

---

awesome implementation plan! yes, please meticulously proceed with your implementation plan Sprint by Sprint, starting with Sprint 1. For each sprint, meticulously create a sub-plan before executing.

---

yes, please meticulously proceed with your sub-plan for Sprint 1.

---

Awesome job with Sprint 1 implementation. Yes, please think deeper to meticulously create the sub-plan for Sprint 2. Review and validate the detailed sub-plan before meticulously proceeding according to it.

---

awesome understanding! please meticulously review and critique the project requirements, README and the project architecture that I will share with you over the next 3 prompts, so wait for me to say you can start a consolidated analysis. then give me your comprehensive analysis and assessment report of the project's design and codebase.

---

awesome understanding! please meticulously review the attached project documents to have a deep and consolidated understanding of the WHAT, WHY and HOW of the project, have a clear understanding of the project's scope, objectives, and existing implementation. Then give me your comprehensive analysis and assessment report of the project's design and codebase, taking into considerations the review comments and the included suggested improvements.

---

Awesome job in your rigorous and meticulous approach in reviewing and analyzing and critique the project's current design based on the shared documents! Please keep up the good work.

One question: did your comprehensive assessment report take into account of the suggested improvements in the attached files `sonnet-1.md` and `sonnet-2.md`? please revisit them and then validate your comprehensive assessment report again.

awesome job in your meticulous validation! the project has been designed and defined, but the codebase is not built yet, so I need you to act as the best coding expert and the best software engineer in the world with very strong UI/UX design tastes to help me build the codebase systematically and in logical phases using the master execution plan (` Master_Execution_Plan_p1.md` and `Master_Execution_Plan-p2.md`) shared as your guide. To me the most critical first step is to define and fix the database schema by creating all the necessary database migration and seed files to serve as the canonical guide for the project code files to follow. do you agree?

Now think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how best to create the complete set of database migration and seed files following the project file structure defined in the `Project_Architecture_Document.md` document. Then meticulously create a comprehensive implementation plan to create all the necessary database migration and seed files in logical phases with a list of migration files for each phase, include a checklist for each logical phase. Review and validate your comprehensive implementation plan to create all the necessary database migration and seed files before presenting the plan for my approval. You need to revisit the shared project documents for validation. Please proceed with extreme care for this very critical step in ensuring a good start for the project.

---

you have done an amazing job with your awesome meticulous planning! yes, please meticulously proceeding according to your implementation plan, phase by phase. Remember to generate the complete working version of each migration and seed file within the ``` tags, and start each file with a comment line with the file's filename + relative path (e.g. `// dirname/filename`).

---

awesome job so far! yes, please meticulously proceed with Phase 2 according to your plan.

---

awesome job so far! please keep up your rigorous and meticulous approach in meticulously planning before execution. 

Now, please meticulously create a comprehensive sub-plan to create all the necessary code files for Phase 0 in the `Master_Execution_Plan`, include a checklist for each file to be created. Review and validate your comprehensive sub implementation plan before presenting the plan for my approval. Please use the following reference files below for your customization and adaption according to the project architecture need.

---

excellent work so far! please keep up your rigorous and meticulous approach in meticulously planning before execution. 

Now, please meticulously create a comprehensive sub-plan to create all the necessary code files for Phase 1 in the `Master_Execution_Plan`, include a checklist for each file to be created. Review and validate your comprehensive sub implementation plan before presenting the plan for my approval. Please use the following reference files below for your customization and adaption according to the project architecture need.

---

awesome meticulous planning! yes, please meticulously proceed according to your plan.

awesome meticulous planning! yes, please meticulously proceed according to your plan. always remember to double-check each file generated for completeness and correctness according to the sub-plan. ensure that each file generated/updated do not contain placeholder comments. since this is a crucial stage, please be more vigilant and diligent in validation.

---

awesome meticulous work so far! but you did not give me the complete working replacement file for `lib/trpc/root.ts`. now, please meticulously double check and validate the following edited version to make sure it is correct and accurate. Remember to always generate a complete working replacement file for each file that needs updating.

---

awesome meticulous work so far! from the "diff" command output below, you did not give me the complete working replacement file for two shown. now, please meticulously double check and validate your last generated version of the two files to make sure they are correct and accurate. Remember to always generate a complete working replacement file for each file that needs updating.

---

awesome job so far! but you did not generate the complete working full replacement for next.config.js. please meticulously review your plan and then generate the complete replacement version for it.

---

awesome review and correction! you also did not generate the complete working replacement file for the following two files that were just updated. please meticulously plan to create the complete updated version with no placeholder comments. you have to double-check them for completeness after re-generating them.

---

awesome job in meticulously double-checking and correctly generating the complete version of the files being updated! please keep up the good work! now, please meticulously review and double-check the following files for completeness and correctness. cross-check against your Phase 8 sub-plan for a proper validation.

---

awesome job so far! please continue to keep up the good work with the rigorous and meticulous approach! now, help me to meticulously review the following build error, then think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how best to fix the issue. Then meticulously create an implementation plan to fix the error. Review and validate the plan before proceeding cautiously.
