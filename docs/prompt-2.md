Awesome job in your rigorous and meticulous approach in reviewing and analyzing and critique the project's v1 documents! Please keep up the good work. 

Yes, I also prefer a more manageable approach to get started, then implement the more ambitious features and functions later. Please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically to re-imagine a more achievable project implementation. I am building a new website and codebase with a more modern design in terms of tech stack, UI/UX and usability. The new website should have a UI/UX more in tune with current trends and yet warm, inviting and caring. The design and codebase should implement all the features and functions that a (small) chain of family clinics (not specialty or advanced) in Singapore serving neighborhood communities of all ages. It should be able to compete with other local family clinic chains in Singapore like https://www.myfamilyclinic.com.sg/ . Please give me a design proposal/blueprint for the website and application makeover. Thank you, my very best design and coding expert in the world.
