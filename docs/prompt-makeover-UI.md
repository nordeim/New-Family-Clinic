Awesome job in your meticulous planning and execution! please keep up the rigorous and meticulous approach in handling the next and future tasks assigned. save this in your agent memory so that you will never forget to use this meticulous approach and methodology in careful thinking, creating comprehensive implementation plan with integrated checklist, review and validate the implementation before executing cautiously according to it.

Now, you new task is to use your deep understanding of the current project codebase from your previous code review to meticulously check which code file needs to be modified or added so that the final codebase after your task completion will look like your proud static mockup as closely as possible (if not better looking). Do a very thorough code files review and validation to draw up a list of files to be updated / added to achieve the task objective. Then meticulously create an implementation plan to add the necessary changes to each file in the to-change list in logical phases and sequence. Your meticulous implementation plan should include a description of change and a checklist for each existing file to be modified and new file to be added. Review and validate the plan to ensure it will exactly achieve the objectives of this important task and mission. Then save.stage the implementation plan first before proceeding cautiously according to the plan.
